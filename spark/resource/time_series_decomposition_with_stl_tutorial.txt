This tutorial is for time series decomposition using STL algorithm as implemented on 
Spark

Environment
===========
Path etc in shell script and configuration file corresposnds to my environment. Please Change 
them  as needed for your environment. Plase the python/lib directory from the project avenir 
in ../lib w.r.t where  stl.sh is located

Build
=====
Follow instructions in spark_dependency.txt

Configuration
=============
Edit stl.conf as needed

Generate product sale related stats
===================================
python seas_sale.py stat <num_products> > stat.txt

where 
num_products = number of products e.g 5

Generate product sale data
==========================
python seas_sale.py gen stat.txt <num_days> > <output_file>

where
num_days = num of days for which to generate data e.g 100
 
Copy output file to the input path as defined in stl.sh

Statistic spark job
===================
./stl.sh numStat

Copy statistic output
=====================
./stl.sh cpStat

Auto correlation spark job
==========================
./stl.sh autoCor

STL decomposition spark job
============================
/stl.sh stl
